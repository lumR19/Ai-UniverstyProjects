# SYMPTOMS AND SEVERITY OF COVID-19 ANALYSIS Project
**Description**:  
This project entails an experimental exploration of machine
learning methodologies, specifically employing the Weka software,
to classify COVID-19 data to determine whether are afflicted with
coronavirus disease or not based on predefined standard
symptoms and whether the person Has contacted to some other
COVID-19 Patient. By applying various algorithms and filters with two diffrent tools Weka & RapidMiner, our
objective is to enhance the accuracy of the classification model.


## Tools Used  
- We chosed two algrothim with the ZEROR algorthim and these
two are Decisionstump and IBK algorthims.
- [Data from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamhungundji/covid19-symptoms-checker)
- Python for data prepration  
- Weka   
- RapidMiner

## Result
In this comparison between the ZeroR, Decision Stump, and IBK algorithms, they were evaluated based on accuracy and model runtime.

ZeroR: While it is the fastest algorithm, it has very low accuracy, making it unsuitable for practical real-world applications.
Decision Stump and IBK: Both achieved 100% accuracy and had a good runtime (2 seconds to build the model).
Conclusion: Both Decision Stump and IBK performed exceptionally well, but since there are no major differences between them, Decision Stump is preferred due to its high efficiency for this type of data.


## My Task
Data prepration , studied and analyzed
“Decision stump” Algorthim
and also orgnized the report.
