# Al-banan project  
**Description**:  
The Al-Banan App Documentation Project aims to create comprehensive and user-friendly documentation for the Al-Banan App, which assists 
Arab deaf individuals in understanding online videos by translating them into Saudi Arabic Sign Language (ArSL).

This documentation will serve as a guide to help users navigate, operate, and maximize the app's features effectively. The primary goal
is to ensure that users can seamlessly use the app for real-time video translation, educational resources, and live virtual classes.

## My Task
As the team leader, I took on key responsibilities, including overseeing the design of the documentation, converting
videos into GIFs, authoring the project documentation, and drafting the final project report.
